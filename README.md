# LEGO Mindstorms EV3 mega library

This repository is a collection of ready-made solutions to various problems.

## Description of contained libraries

* [**PID regulation**](https://github.com/pechhenka/Lego-mega-library/tree/master/PID%20regulation) - Using this library, you can create any quantity of controllers with different configurations, that is, P, I, PI, PD, PID, etc.
* [**Reflected Light Calibration**](https://github.com/pechhenka/Lego-mega-library/tree/master/Reflected%20Light%20Calibration) - Using this library, you can calibrate the sensors so that on the same gray tint they produce the same values, indicating their minimum output value (black color) and maximum (white color)
* [**ColorSensorRGB**](https://github.com/pechhenka/Lego-mega-library/tree/master/ColorSensorRGB) - Read color sensor a value from an RGB
